Heart Rate Zones Analytics Module

This module provides comprehensive heart rate zone calculations based on various
maximum heart rate models including:
- BCF/ABCC/WCPP Revised (7 zones) - British Cycling Federation
- Peter Keen (4 zones) - Original British Cycling method  
- Ric Stern (7 zones) - Alternative 7-zone system
- Sally Edwards (5 zones) - Heart Zones methodology
- Timex (5 zones) - Traditional 5-zone system
- MyProCoach (5 zones) - Performance-based zones

Each method provides zone ranges with detailed explanations of training purposes
and physiological adaptations for user understanding.
