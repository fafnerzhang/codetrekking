# Critical Pace/Power Curve Calculation Mechanism - Design Plan

*Last updated: August 25, 2025*

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for a comprehensive critical pace/power curve calculation mechanism. Based on research from High North Running and current scientific literature, this system will support both traditional hyperbolic (critical power) models and modern power-law alternatives for endurance performance analysis.

## Background & Research Foundation

### Key Sources
- **High North Running**: Critical Pace and Power for Runners
- **NIH Research**: Power laws vs critical power model for endurance exercise
- **Running Writings**: Critical Speed Model applications
- **Sports Science Literature**: Latest advances in power-duration relationship modeling

### Core Concepts
Critical pace/power models are fundamental tools for:
- Understanding endurance performance capacity
- Determining optimal training zones
- Predicting race performance
- Designing interval training programs
- Monitoring fitness progression

## Mathematical Models Foundation

### 1. Hyperbolic (Critical Power) Model

The traditional critical power model describes the power-duration relationship as:

```
P = W'/T + CP
```

**For Pace/Running Applications:**
```
Pace = D'/T + Critical_Pace
Distance = Critical_Pace × Time + D'
```

**Key Parameters:**
- **CP (Critical Power/Pace)**: Asymptotic threshold representing maximum sustainable intensity
- **W'/D'**: Finite capacity above critical power
  - Power: Measured in kilojoules (kJ)  
  - Running: Measured in meters (D')

**Validity Range:** Most accurate for 2-20 minute duration efforts

### 2. Power-Law (Riegel) Model

Modern alternative that may be more realistic across broader duration ranges:

```
P = S × T^(E-1)
```

**Parameters:**
- **S**: Speed parameter (power sustainable for 1 second)
- **E**: Endurance parameter (0 < E < 1, determines curve decay rate)
- **F = 1/E**: Fatigue factor

**Advantages:**
- More accurate for durations outside 2-15 minute range
- Better representation of real-world performance curves
- Accounts for different fatigue patterns across athletes

### 3. Model Selection Criteria

| Duration Range | Recommended Model | Rationale |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| 2-20 minutes  | Hyperbolic       | Well-validated, physiologically meaningful |
| < 2 minutes   | Power-Law        | Better neuromuscular power representation |
| > 20 minutes  | Power-Law        | Accounts for metabolic/thermal limitations |
| All ranges    | Hybrid           | Model selection based on data fit quality |

## Core Calculation Engine Architecture

### Data Input Requirements

```python
class PerformanceData:
    """
    Standard performance data structure for model fitting
    """
    distance: float      # meters
    time: float         # seconds  
    power: float        # watts (optional, for cycling/power-based sports)
    pace: float         # m/s or min/km
    conditions: dict    # environmental factors
    effort_type: str    # race, time_trial, workout, test
    quality_score: float # data reliability (0-1)
    date: datetime      # when performance occurred
```

### Model Fitting Algorithms

#### 1. Linear Regression Approach (Hyperbolic Model)
```python
# Distance vs Time relationship: Distance = CS × Time + D'
# Slope = Critical Speed (CS)
# Y-intercept = D' (distance capacity above CS)
```

#### 2. Log-Linear Regression (Power-Law Model)
```python
# log(P) = log(S) + (E-1) × log(T)
# Linear regression on log-transformed data
```

#### 3. Advanced Fitting Options
- **Non-linear Least Squares**: Direct parameter optimization
- **Weighted Regression**: Account for data quality differences
- **Robust Regression**: Minimize outlier influence
- **Bayesian Estimation**: Incorporate prior knowledge and uncertainty

### Statistical Validation

#### Model Quality Metrics
- **R-squared values**: Goodness of fit (target: R² > 0.95)
- **Standard errors**: Parameter uncertainty estimation
- **Confidence intervals**: 95% bounds for practical applications
- **Cross-validation**: Out-of-sample prediction accuracy
- **Residual analysis**: Check for systematic errors

#### Data Quality Requirements
```markdown
Minimum Requirements:
- 2-3 performances for basic fitting
- Duration range coverage: 3-15 minutes minimum

Recommended Standards:
- 3-5 high-quality performances

## Training Zone Determination

### Critical Speed Boundaries

Based on statistical analysis of the critical speed parameter:

```python
def calculate_training_zones(critical_speed, standard_error):
    """
    Calculate training zones based on critical speed and confidence intervals
    """
    cs_minus = critical_speed - (1.96 * standard_error)  # CS- (97.5% confidence)
    cs_plus = critical_speed + (1.96 * standard_error)   # CS+ (97.5% confidence)
    
    # Alternative: Fixed percentage approach
    cs_minus_fixed = critical_speed * 0.97  # CS - 3%
    cs_plus_fixed = critical_speed * 1.03   # CS + 3%
    
    return cs_minus, cs_plus
```

### Zone Classification System

| Zone | Intensity Range | Physiological Target | Training Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1 | < 80% CS | Active Recovery | Recovery, aerobic base |
| 2 | 80-90% CS | Aerobic Base | Mitochondrial development |
| 3 | 90-95% CS | Tempo/Threshold | Lactate clearance, efficiency |
| 4 | 95-100% CS (CS-) | High-end Aerobic | VO2max development |
| 5 | 100-105% CS (CS+) | Anaerobic Capacity | W'/D' expansion |
| 6 | > 105% CS | Neuromuscular | Speed, power development |

### Integration with Existing Training Systems

#### Daniels VDOT Equivalents
- **CS- ≈ T pace** (Threshold pace)
- **CS+ ≈ I pace** (Interval pace)
- **Zone 2-3 ≈ M pace** (Marathon pace range)

#### Polarized Training Model
- **Zone 1-2**: 80% of training volume
- **Zone 4-5**: 20% of training volume  
- **Zone 3**: Minimize time (avoid "gray zone")

## Performance Prediction & Pacing

### Race Time Prediction

#### Input Parameters
```python
class PredictionRequest:
    target_distance: float    # meters
    environmental_factors: dict  # wind, temperature, altitude
    pacing_strategy: str     # even, negative_split, positive_split
    current_fitness: dict    # recent test results, training load
```

#### Prediction Algorithms

**Hyperbolic Model Prediction:**
```python
def predict_time_hyperbolic(distance, critical_speed, d_prime):
    """
    Predict sustainable time for given distance using hyperbolic model
    """
    if distance <= d_prime:
        # Distance achievable above critical speed
        # Solve: distance = cs * time + d_prime - cs * time
        return distance / critical_speed
    else:
        # Distance requires contribution from both CS and D'
        # Solve: distance = cs * time + d_prime
        return (distance - d_prime) / critical_speed
```

**Power-Law Model Prediction:**
```python
def predict_time_power_law(distance, speed_param, endurance_param):
    """
    Predict time using power-law model parameters
    """
    # Rearrange: P = S × T^(E-1) to solve for T
    # T = (P/S)^(1/(E-1))
    target_speed = distance # Needs pace conversion
    return (target_speed / speed_param) ** (1 / (endurance_param - 1))
```

### Pacing Strategy Optimization

#### Even Pacing (Recommended)
- **Principle**: Minimize energy cost through consistent effort
- **Application**: Most races, especially longer distances
- **Calculation**: Target pace = predicted average pace ± 0%

#### Negative Split Strategy
- **Principle**: Conservative start, strong finish
- **Application**: Tactical races, uncertain conditions  
- **Calculation**: First half at 102-105% of even pace, second half at 95-98%

#### Energy Expenditure Modeling

Track W'/D' depletion during race execution:

```python
def calculate_energy_depletion(current_pace, critical_pace, duration, d_prime):
    """
    Calculate D' depletion for given pace and duration
    """
    if current_pace > critical_pace:
        depletion_rate = (current_pace - critical_pace)
        total_depletion = depletion_rate * duration
        remaining_capacity = d_prime - total_depletion
        return max(0, remaining_capacity)
    else:
        # Below critical pace - gradual recovery
        recovery_rate = 0.1  # 10% recovery per time unit below CP
        return min(d_prime, d_prime * recovery_rate * duration)
```

## Fatigue Modeling & Recovery

### W'/D' Depletion Tracking

#### Depletion During Exercise
- **Above Critical Power**: Linear depletion proportional to power excess
- **Rate Calculation**: `depletion_rate = (P_current - CP) / W_prime`
- **Time to Exhaustion**: `t_exhaustion = W_prime / (P_current - CP)`

#### Recovery Below Critical Power
- **Exponential Recovery**: W'/D' reconstitution follows exponential curve
- **Time Constants**: Individual recovery rates (typically 2-8 minutes)
- **Active vs Passive**: Active recovery at 40-60% CP may accelerate reconstitution

### Interval Training Optimization

#### Work/Rest Ratio Calculation
```python
def calculate_optimal_intervals(target_intensity, critical_power, w_prime, recovery_rate):
    """
    Calculate optimal work/rest ratios for interval training
    """
    # Work duration: deplete specific percentage of W'
    target_depletion = 0.7  # 70% of W' capacity
    work_duration = (w_prime * target_depletion) / (target_intensity - critical_power)
    
    # Rest duration: allow sufficient recovery
    rest_duration = work_duration / recovery_rate
    
    return work_duration, rest_duration
```

#### Session Design Principles
- **CS- Training**: 4-6 × 8-15 minutes at CS-, 3-5 minute recoveries
- **CS+ Training**: 6-12 × 2-5 minutes at CS+, 2-3 minute recoveries  
- **W'/D' Development**: Short intervals (30s-2min) at 110-120% CS

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Modal Support

#### Running Applications
- **Primary Metric**: Speed/pace (m/s, min/km, min/mile)
- **Environmental Corrections**: Wind resistance, grade adjustment
- **Surface Factors**: Track vs road vs trail coefficients

#### Cycling Applications  
- **Primary Metric**: Power output (watts, watts/kg)

### Environmental Corrections

#### Wind Resistance
```python
def adjust_for_wind(pace, wind_speed, wind_direction, body_area=0.4):
    """
    Adjust pace for wind resistance effects
    """
    # Simplified model - actual implementation needs more sophisticated aerodynamics
    drag_coefficient = 0.9
    air_density = 1.225  # kg/m³ at sea level
    
    relative_wind = wind_speed * cos(wind_direction)  # headwind positive
    drag_force = 0.5 * drag_coefficient * air_density * body_area * (pace + relative_wind)**2
    
    # Convert drag force to pace adjustment
    return pace * (1 + drag_force / 1000)  # Simplified conversion
```

#### Altitude Corrections
- **VO2max Impact**: ~1% decrease per 300m above 1500m elevation
- **Critical Power Adjustment**: Proportional to VO2max changes
- **Air Density**: Reduced drag at altitude (slight benefit for speed)

#### Temperature Effects
- **Heat Stress**: Performance decline above 15°C ambient temperature
- **Dehydration**: Progressive performance loss with fluid loss
- **Thermal Regulation**: Energy cost of thermoregulation

### Long-term Tracking

#### Fitness Progression Monitoring
```python
class FitnessProgression:
    """
    Track changes in critical power parameters over time
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.cs_history = []  # Critical speed progression
        self.d_prime_history = []  # D' capacity changes
        self.test_dates = []
        self.training_load = []  # Weekly/monthly training metrics
    
    def calculate_fitness_trend(self, time_window_days=90):
        """
        Calculate rate of fitness change over specified time window
        """
        # Linear regression on recent CS values
        # Return slope (fitness change per week)
        pass
    
    def predict_peak_fitness(self, taper_plan):
        """
        Predict fitness peak based on taper/training plan
        """
        # Model fitness response to training load changes
        pass
```

#### Periodization Support
- **Base Phase**: Focus on CS improvement through volume
- **Build Phase**: Develop W'/D' through targeted intervals
- **Peak Phase**: Integrate speed and race-specific efforts
- **Taper Phase**: Maintain fitness while optimizing parameters

## Runner Ability Distribution Framework

### Mathematical Theory for Performance Classification

Based on research from Blythe & Király (2016) and recent advances in performance modeling, we can establish a comprehensive framework for determining runner ability distributions using critical pace/power curve parameters.

#### 1. Theoretical Foundation

**Individual Performance Model**
Following the PLOS ONE research, individual performance can be modeled as:
```
log(t) = λ₁ · f₁(s) + λ₂ · f₂(s) + λ₃ · f₃(s)
```

Where:
- `t` = time (seconds)
- `s` = distance (meters) 
- `λ₁, λ₂, λ₃` = individual coefficients (3-parameter summary)
- `f₁(s) = log(s)` (individual power law component)
- `f₂(s), f₃(s)` = non-linear correction components

**Critical Power Integration**
The critical power model integrates with this framework:
```
CP_normalized = (CP - μ_population) / σ_population
D'_normalized = (D' - μ_D') / σ_D'
```

#### 2. Distribution Models for Athletic Performance

**A. Log-Normal Distribution Model**
Athletic performance times typically follow log-normal distributions:

```python
def log_normal_performance_distribution(μ, σ, distance):
    """
    Model performance time distribution for a given distance
    """
    # μ = mean of log(performance_time)
    # σ = standard deviation of log(performance_time)
    return scipy.stats.lognorm(s=σ, scale=np.exp(μ))
```

**Mathematical Properties:**
- **PDF**: `f(t) = (1/(t·σ·√(2π))) · exp(-(ln(t)-μ)²/(2σ²))`
- **Percentiles**: `P(k) = exp(μ + σ·Φ⁻¹(k/100))`
- **Mean**: `exp(μ + σ²/2)`
- **Median**: `exp(μ)`

**B. Weibull Distribution Model**
For certain performance metrics, Weibull distributions may be more appropriate:

```python
def weibull_performance_distribution(k, λ):
    """
    Weibull distribution for performance modeling
    k: shape parameter (k > 1 indicates improving with time)
    λ: scale parameter (characteristic performance level)
    """
    return scipy.stats.weibull_min(c=k, scale=λ)
```

**Mathematical Properties:**
- **PDF**: `f(t) = (k/λ)·(t/λ)^(k-1)·exp(-(t/λ)^k)`
- **Percentiles**: `P(k) = λ·(-ln(1-k/100))^(1/k)`
- **Mean**: `λ·Γ(1 + 1/k)`

#### 3. Critical Power-Based Ability Classification

**A. Multi-Dimensional Performance Space**

Create a performance space using critical power parameters:

```python
class PerformanceSpace:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dimensions = {
            'critical_speed': 'Endurance capacity (m/s)',
            'd_prime': 'Anaerobic capacity (m)',
            'power_exponent': 'Individual power law exponent', 
            'specialization_index': 'Event specialization factor'
        }
    
    def calculate_ability_vector(self, athlete_data):
        """
        Transform athlete into standardized performance space
        """
        cs_normalized = (athlete_data.cs - self.population_cs_mean) / self.population_cs_std
        dp_normalized = (athlete_data.d_prime - self.population_dp_mean) / self.population_dp_std
        exp_normalized = (athlete_data.exponent - self.population_exp_mean) / self.population_exp_std
        
        return np.array([cs_normalized, dp_normalized, exp_normalized])
```

**B. Percentile Calculation Framework**

```python
def calculate_performance_percentiles(athlete_vector, reference_population):
    """
    Calculate multi-dimensional performance percentiles
    """
    # Mahalanobis distance for multivariate percentile
    cov_matrix = np.cov(reference_population.T)
    inv_cov_matrix = np.linalg.inv(cov_matrix)
    
    # Distance from population center
    diff = athlete_vector - np.mean(reference_population, axis=0)

## 9. Phenotype-Based Classification System (WKO5 Adaptation)

### 9.1 Overview

Drawing from the WKO5 cycling phenotype classification system, we adapt the power duration curve concepts to create a comprehensive runner classification framework. This system maps running capabilities to cycling terminology while maintaining methodological rigor.

### 9.2 Core Metrics

**Critical Pace (CP)**: Analogous to cycling's FTP, represents the highest pace that can be sustained in a quasi-steady state for prolonged periods.

**Anaerobic Work Capacity (AWC)**: Equivalent to cycling's FRC (Functional Reserve Capacity), represents the total work above CP before exhaustion.

**Peak Pace Power (PPP)**: Similar to cycling's Pmax, represents maximal neuromuscular power output over very short durations (5-15 seconds).

**Pace Duration Curve Shape**: Characterized by power-law exponent and hyperbolic curve fit parameters.

### 9.5 Percentile-Based Performance Standards

The classification system incorporates performance percentiles based on population data:

**Performance Levels:**
- **World Class**: >99th percentile
- **Exceptional**: 95-99th percentile  
- **Excellent**: 85-95th percentile
- **Very Good**: 70-85th percentile
- **Good**: 50-70th percentile
- **Fair**: 25-50th percentile
- **Untrained**: <25th percentile

### 9.6 Training Implications

Each phenotype suggests specific training adaptations:

#### All-Rounder Training
- **Volume**: Moderate to high
- **Intensity Distribution**: Polarized (80% easy, 20% hard)
- **Key Sessions**: Mixed-pace runs, tempo intervals, speed work
- **Periodization**: Event-specific with balanced development

#### Pursuiter Training
- **Volume**: Moderate
- **Intensity Distribution**: Pyramid (70% easy, 20% moderate, 10% hard)
- **Key Sessions**: VO2max intervals, anaerobic repeats
- **Periodization**: High-intensity focus with aerobic base

#### Sprinter Training
- **Volume**: Lower
- **Intensity Distribution**: Concentrated high intensity
- **Key Sessions**: Neuromuscular power, speed endurance, acceleration
- **Periodization**: Power-speed emphasis with minimal volume

#### Time Trialer Training
- **Volume**: High
- **Intensity Distribution**: Polarized with threshold emphasis
- **Key Sessions**: Threshold runs, long aerobic efforts
- **Periodization**: High volume with sustained pace work

### 9.7 Validation and Monitoring

The phenotype classification should be validated through:

1. **Performance History Analysis**: Comparing predicted strengths with race results
2. **Training Response**: Monitoring adaptation to specific training stimuli
3. **Physiological Testing**: Correlating with lab-based measurements
4. **Longitudinal Tracking**: Observing phenotype evolution over training cycles
